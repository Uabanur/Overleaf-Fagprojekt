In order to appreciate the full potential of photonic communication we wish to create a highly efficient passive component, to preserve the data speed and minimise heat production. Our component has no moving parts, but instead operates by manipulating the light through change of refractive index. A device with the same goals was previously created at Stanford, as presented in the article "Inverse design and demonstration of a compact and broadband on-chip wavelength demultiplexer" \cite{Stanford} with use of the Edisonian approach, whereas we are interested in the inverse design method with hopes of better results.
